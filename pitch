Headline: The Story of NYC Trees

Data:
NYC Tree Census Data from 1995 and 2015 

Question: 
I am looking to compare tree census data in order to assess tree population and how it compares in different neighborhoods. Is there a lack of trees in certain neighborhoods does it link to poverty, higher pollution rates, asthma rates, etc?

Info:
The data is comprehensive. Complete lists of tree locations with borough and NTA codes are provided. I have collected data columns on NTA codes, corresponding NTA boroughs, the cities corresponding to each NTA code, count of trees in both 1995 and 2015. 
Other data I haven't used but that may come in handy includes tree status, tree species, and tree health
