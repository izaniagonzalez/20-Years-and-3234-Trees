      <h1>Hunts Point Sees 11.3% Increase in Tree Population in 20 Years</h1>
      <h4>By Izania Gonzalez</h4>
      <article>
        <p>From 1995 to 2015 the tree population of New York City saw some pretty significant changes - both increasing and decreasing. The most significant change lies in the 3,234 trees planted in Hunts Point.</p>
        <p>The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation is responsible for this leap in tree population. As part of a plan to plant trees in areas with high asthma rates and air pollution they targeted neighborhoods like Hunts Point hoping the increase in trees would help counteract the high levels of air pollution.</p>

<p>The heavy <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/d03df982a6e54753a2821746e175f11d"> air pollution</a> has historical founding in the infrastructure design of Robert Moses, from the mid 1900s. Industrialization commenced in areas of the Bronx and industrial buildings, traffic heavy throughways, and waste facilities were placed in their neighborhoods. The reality of environmental injustice plagues the air of this area because of decisions made by politicians for people often overlooked because of its majority minority population and low income bracket status.</p>
<p>The Parks Department drafted up the plan in 2003 and named MillionTrees NYC. The project planted their one millionth tree in November of 2015 in Joyce Kilmer Park in the Bronx. The program is still going strong, planting trees all over the cities in parks and on private land. You can read more about it <a href="https://www.milliontreesnyc.org/">here.</a></p>
